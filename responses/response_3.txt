I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, but I'm glad you reached out. It's important to talk about these feelings. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on or what's making you feel this way? Remember, you're not alone, and together we can explore these feelings and work on ways to improve how you feel about yourself.
