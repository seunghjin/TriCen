I'm sorry to hear that you had that experience. It can be really tough when comments from friends impact our self-esteem. Here are some steps that might help you navigate this situation:

1. **Reflect on the Comment**: Take a moment to think about the comment itself. Was it intended to be hurtful, or could it have been a careless remark without bad intentions? This can help in addressing the issue with your friend.

2. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It’s completely valid to feel hurt or self-conscious when someone comments on your body. Acknowledge how you feel and understand that it’s okay to be upset.

3. **Communicate Your Feelings**: Consider discussing how you felt with your friend. Choose a time when you both are calm, and you can express your feelings without the conversation becoming heated. You might say something like, “When you said that about my body, it made me feel self-conscious. I'd appreciate it if we could avoid remarks like that in the future.”

4. **Set Boundaries**: It's important to set boundaries around what is acceptable in conversations with your friend. Let them know what makes you uncomfortable and explain how certain comments can affect your well-being.

5. **Surround Yourself with Support**: Spend time with friends and family who uplift you. Positive reinforcement from loved ones can greatly improve your self-esteem and help mitigate the negative feelings caused by hurtful comments.

6. **Work on Self-Acceptance**: Try to focus on appreciating your body for what it does rather than how it looks. Engaging in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as exercise, hobbies, or relaxation techniques, can enhance your self-image.

7. **Seek Professional Help if Needed**: If you find that the comment has deeply affected your self-esteem or triggered more serious issues related to body image, talking to a mental health professional can be very beneficial.

Remember, your value does not decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth. Your body is your own, and it’s important to care for and respect it as it is.
